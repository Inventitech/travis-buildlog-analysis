Query used to select projects

```sql
select u.login, p.name, p.language, count(*)
from projects p, users u, watchers w
where
    p.forked_from is null and
    p.deleted is false and
    w.repo_id = p.id and
    u.id = p.owner_id
group by p.id
having count(*) > 50
order by count(*) desc
```
You can then call the Travis Poker to see whether these projects use Travis CI or not. Projects will be annotated with a binary flag indicating this.

To further process the list generated by Travis Poker, do
```bash
grep "true" results.csv > travis_enabled
sed -i 's/\([^,]*\),\([^,]*\).*/\1 \2/' travis_enabled
```

This list can now be passed to the Travis Harvester, for which we use parallel.

Retrieve build logs of 20 GH project simultaneously (beware, depending on your network connection this puts a heavy load on Travis-CI!)
```bash
cat travis-enabled | parallel -j 20 --colsep ' ' ruby bin/travis_harvester.rb
```

### Extracting GitHub features about each build

To extract features for one project, do

 ```bash
 ruby -Ibin bin/build_data_extraction.rb stripe brushfire github-token
 ```
 where `github-token` is a valid GitHub OAuth token used to download information about commits

To extract features for multiple projects in parallel, you need

* A file (`project-list`) of projects, in the format specified above
* A file (`token-list`) of one or more Github tokens, one token per line

Then, run
```ruby
./bin/project_token.rb project-list token-list | sort -R > projects-tokens
./bin/all_projects.sh -p 4 -d data projects-tokens
```

this will create a file with tokens equi-distributed to projects
a directory `data`, and start 4 instanced of the `build_data_extraction.rb` script


### Analyzing Buildlogs
Our buildlog dispatcher handles everything that you typically want: It generates on convenient CSV per project directory, and invokes an automatically dispatched correct buildlog analyzer. You can start the per-project analysis (typically on a directory structured checkedout through travis-harvester) via
```ruby
ruby bin/buildlog_analyzer_dispatcher.rb directory-of-project-to-analyze 
```


To start to analyze all buildlogs, parallel helps us again:
```bash
ls build_logs | parallel -j 5 ruby bin/buildlog_analyzer_dispatcher.rb "build_logs/{}"
```
